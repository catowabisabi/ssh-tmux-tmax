## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Each release runs npm run test:e2e as a gate. The suite spawns a real Electron window per spec and on the user's Windows machine takes several minutes end-to-end - long enough that it noticeably slows the release cadence. Want to reduce the runtime: parallelize specs that don't conflict on focus or window state, share a single Electron launch across compatible specs, drop redundant waits, or split the gate into a fast tier (must pass) + slow tier (nightly). Open: figure out where the time is actually spent (per-spec breakdown), then pick the highest-leverage cuts.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Per-spec runtime breakdown captured so we know where the time goes
- [ ] #2 Median full-suite runtime drops materially vs current baseline (target: under 2 minutes for the must-pass tier)
- [ ] #3 Specs that exercise window focus or app-wide state still run in isolation
- [ ] #4 Release skill still uses the suite as a gate - just a faster one
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Closed 2026-05-03: deprioritised. Skipping the e2e gate during the 1.7.x cycle has been working fine; runtime isn't blocking releases. Re-open if e2e moves back to mandatory-on-every-release.
<!-- SECTION:NOTES:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Won't do for now - infra perf deferred. Re-open when e2e becomes a release gate again.
