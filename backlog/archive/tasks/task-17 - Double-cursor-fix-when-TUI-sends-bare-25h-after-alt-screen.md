## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Earlier alt-screen + bracketed-paste fix only re-hid the cursor when ?2004/?1049 appeared in the chunk. Bare ?25h slipped through. Now we re-hide when either signal is on, regardless of what triggered the chunk. Playwright regression added.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 isCursorHidden stays true through ?1049h ?2004h then bare ?25h
- [x] #2 Playwright test asserts the above
