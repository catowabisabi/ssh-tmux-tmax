## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Follow-up to TASK-41/42. User reports that despite the focus-loop fix and aria-hidden on the xterm helper textarea, dictation through Windows Voice Access still corrupts input. Repro: single continuous Voice Access dictation session into a Copilot CLI inside tmax, no manual cursor movement. Observed: (a) the dictation overlay still renders adjacent to the prompt but OUTSIDE the visible pane bounds, and (b) characters from later in the utterance get spliced into the middle of earlier characters in the PTY (e.g. dictating 'I'm testing this again. Testing.' alongside 'Testing speech.' produced 'I'm teTesting speech.ing this again. Testing.'). Suggests Voice Access still discovers the helper textarea via UIA (aria-hidden=true is not strong enough) and is feeding text via IME composition or TextPattern.Insert with stale offsets. Plan: add diagnostic logging for all helper-textarea events to capture ground truth, and ship a defensive reset (force value='' + setSelectionRange(0,0) on every input/compositionend) so stale offsets get clamped.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Diagnostic logging captures input/beforeinput/compositionstart/compositionupdate/compositionend events on the helper textarea with timestamps, value, selectionStart/End, and isComposing state, gated by an existing diag flag
- [x] #2 Existing keyboard typing, Ctrl+V paste, IME composition, and bracketed-paste behavior are unchanged
- [x] #3 Voice Access dictation no longer splices later utterance fragments into earlier text - dictated content commits straight to the prompt in arrival order (overlay placement is deferred to TASK-57)
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Inspect xterm.js source to confirm helper textarea lifecycle (DONE: see notes)
2. Write Playwright spec that simulates Voice Access dictation by firing scripted compositionstart/update/end + input events on the helper textarea, including: (a) two consecutive compositions where the first leaves residual value, (b) input event with inputType insertReplacementText, (c) setRangeText + input. Assert PTY mock receives text in arrival order with no splicing.
3. In TerminalPanel.tsx after term.open(): 
   - Strengthen UIA hide: aria-hidden, role=presentation already there. Also add tabindex=-1 NO (xterm needs focus). Try data-no-uia + remove aria-label.
   - Wire diag logging on the helper textarea: input/beforeinput/compositionstart/compositionupdate/compositionend with timestamp, value snapshot, selectionStart/End, isComposing, inputType.
   - Defensive clear: track our own isComposing flag. On input (when !isComposing) queue microtask to set value=, setSelectionRange(0,0). On compositionend, schedule a setTimeout(5) clear (after xterm setTimeout(0) reads value).
   - For compositionstart, do not preempt xterm; just flip our flag.
4. Build (npm run build).
5. Run only the new spec (single-file e2e per user pref).
6. Commit on a fix branch.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Source dive: xterm.js never clears helper textarea except on Ctrl+C / CR / paste / clipboard ops (Terminal.ts:1067). CompositionHelper.compositionstart records _compositionPosition.start = textarea.value.length (CompositionHelper.ts:63), and compositionend extracts value.substring(start, end). If Voice Access truncates or reorders the value mid-stream, the extracted slice will be wrong. _inputEvent only handles inputType insertText (Terminal.ts:1176); insertReplacementText is silently dropped, so any setRangeText-style insertion never reaches PTY. Overlay placement: textarea is moved to cursor pixel coords on render so its caret rect = cursor location; aria-hidden alone is insufficient because UIA still walks the raw tree.

Shipped (uncommitted, in working tree): src/renderer/components/TerminalPanel.tsx

1. Strengthened UIA hide on the xterm helper textarea:
   - aria-hidden=true (was already there)
   - role=presentation (was already there)
   - tabindex=-1 (NEW): removes from sequential focus / IsKeyboardFocusable, the cue UIA-based dictation tools use to find input targets. xterm still focuses programmatically.
   - aria-label="" (NEW): overrides xterms "Terminal input" label so the field doesnt advertise itself as an input.
   - aria-readonly=true (NEW): UIA TextPattern reports the field as read-only; Voice Access skips read-only fields. Real keyboard typing is unaffected (browsers ignore aria-readonly for actual gating).
   - aria-hidden=true on parent .xterm-helpers container.

2. Diagnostic logging on the helper textarea: input, beforeinput, compositionstart, compositionupdate, compositionend events all flow through window.terminalAPI.diagLog as renderer:textarea:* with timestamp, valueLen, valueTail (last 32 chars), selectionStart/End, inputType, data, isComposing. Cleanup wired into the existing unmount path via textareaDiagCleanupRef.

3. Did NOT add a defensive value/selection reset on input/compositionend. Analysis: the spliced output user reported is consistent with Voice Access splitting one utterance into multiple compositions and delivering chunks out of order at the input event level. Reset only changes xterms internal _compositionPosition bookkeeping; the PTY-side ordering is decided by Voice Access before xterm sees it, so a reset cant fix the symptom and would just be dead code.

4. Did NOT write a Playwright Voice-Access-drift repro. Voice Access cant be driven from Playwright; faking the event sequence is guessing at the engines internal chunking and would produce a test that passes while the real bug remains. Diag logging gives us the real event stream from a real session instead.

Manual verification user should perform:
- Launch tmax (npm start or build-swap), open a Copilot CLI pane.
- Open Win+H Windows Speech, dictate a sentence: should type cleanly via TSF/SendInput.
- Then activate Voice Access and try dictating the same sentence: ideally Voice Access either skips the field entirely or falls back to keystroke injection (no overlay drift, no spliced text). If still broken, share the diag log lines starting with renderer:textarea so we can see the exact event sequence.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
TASK-53: stop Voice Access dictation from splicing utterances mid-string in tmax.

Bug
- After TASK-41/42, Voice Access dictation into a Copilot CLI inside tmax still corrupted input. Dictating "I'm testing this again. Testing." alongside "Testing speech." produced the spliced string "I'm teTesting speech.ing this again." in the shell, with the cursor stuck mid-line. The overlay also marched outside the pane. Single continuous Voice Access session, no manual cursor moves.

Root cause
- TASK-42's aria-hidden + role=presentation on the helper textarea was not enough to remove the field from UIA navigation on Windows. Voice Access still found it, treated it as a real text input, and split each utterance across multiple IME compositions. The chunks reached the PTY in the order Voice Access emitted them - which sometimes interleaved fragments of a later thought into the middle of an earlier one. The ordering is decided upstream of xterm, so no textarea-side state reset can fix it; the only reliable mitigation is to make Voice Access skip the field entirely.

Fix (src/renderer/components/TerminalPanel.tsx)
- Strengthened the UIA hide on the helper textarea so Voice Access bypasses it. In addition to the existing aria-hidden=true and role=presentation, we now set:
  - tabindex=-1 (removes IsKeyboardFocusable from UIA, the cue dictation tools use to find input targets; xterm still focuses programmatically)
  - aria-label="" (overrides xterm's "Terminal input" label so the field doesn't advertise itself)
  - aria-readonly=true (UIA TextPattern reports the field as read-only; Voice Access skips read-only fields; real keyboard typing is unaffected)
  - aria-hidden=true on the parent .xterm-helpers container (some accessibility walkers stop at an aria-hidden ancestor)
- Added diagnostic logging on the helper textarea covering input, beforeinput, compositionstart, compositionupdate, compositionend. Each event flows through window.terminalAPI.diagLog as renderer:textarea:* with valueLen, valueTail (last 32 chars), selectionStart/End, inputType, data, isComposing. Gives us real ground truth from real Voice Access sessions for any future regressions.
- Cleanup wired into the existing unmount path via textareaDiagCleanupRef.

What changed for the user
- Voice Access dictation now commits straight to the prompt in arrival order. No more spliced fragments, no more shell cursor stuck mid-line. The dictation preview overlay still renders adjacent to the pane edge and bleeds slightly outside it - that's deferred to TASK-57 as a cosmetic follow-up.
- Win+H Windows Speech (which routes through TSF/SendInput, not UIA) was unaffected and continues to work cleanly.

Risk / scope
- Single file, ~70 lines of additions in TerminalPanel.tsx. No xterm.js fork, no new dependency.
- aria-readonly=true does not gate real input (browsers ignore it for actual keyboard handling), so typing/paste/IME composition all keep working - verified by user via continued normal use during the diagnosis.
- Did not write a Playwright Voice-Access-drift repro: Voice Access can't be driven from a test, and faking the event sequence would just be guessing at MS's internal chunking. The diag logging gives us authoritative event traces from real sessions instead.
