/**
 * Run the "jump to this prompt" search and bring the match to a useful spot
 * on screen. Shared between the latest-prompt banner click and the
 * Ctrl+Shift+K dialog so both behave identically.
 *
 * Behavior we want from a click:
 *  - The match becomes visible.
 *  - There's a few rows of context above the match (so the user can read
 *    the surrounding turn, not just the prompt at the very edge).
 *  - The decoration goes away the moment the user starts scrolling, because
 *    the search addon's decoration drifts a row when xterm repaints during
 *    scroll - that visual jitter is what users perceive as "highlight
 *    glitches when I scroll".
 *
 * Why we scroll manually after findPrevious: xterm-addon-search only scrolls
 * when the match is fully outside the viewport. If the match was already at
 * the bottom edge, the addon does nothing, the highlight lands on the very
 * last visible row, and the user reads it as "it didn't scroll there." We
 * recenter ourselves so the result is consistent regardless of starting
 * scroll position.
